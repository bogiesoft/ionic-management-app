# My first application using the Ionic framework. 

The framework is versatible as it can build for both android and ios platforms using the same combination of languages, html/css/js. THe learning curve is not steep, which makes the framework very useful for prototyping business ideas.

One concern is the final quality of the application. This test proved that native development still offers better overal look and feel and performance.


__How to install:__

Follow [official docs](http://ionicframework.com/docs/guide/installation.html) to have Ionic installed in your machine.
